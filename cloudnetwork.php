        Cloud computing supports centralised resources accessible to authorised clients remotely, however unlike housing these management resources within a data center infrastructure with dedicated hardware, they are hosted within the cloud on its distributed servers. Cloud deployment has three categories: public clouds operated by third parties; private clouds containing services and infrastructure of a private network; and hybrid clouds combining both private and public. Innovations and improvements within accessibility, IoT devices and WAN bandwidth have aided the expansion of cloud networking and management. Fundamental characteristics include:      </p>
      <ul class="b">
        <li> On-demand self-service: provides higher level of control as well as the capability for adaption to services and the network with ease, speed and mitigating cloud vendor interaction.</li>
        <li> Broad network access: available to all devices.</li>
        <li>	Resource pooling: a multi-tenant model that caters for dynamic flexibility for resource provisioning.</li>
        <li> Rapid elasticity: fast and efficient scaling in conjunction with demand reducing capacity planning.</li>
        <li>Measured service: monitoring and metering to provide the most efficient service. (Peter Mell, 2011)</li>

        Software as a service (SaaS) provides clients with remote access to an application through either thin (browser) or thick (program interface) connections to the cloud. Holds a faster migration than PaaS however it requires support to integrate and restructure. Employee training is also a resource that would need to be considered in this migration. Platform as a service (PaaS) offers the customer the ability to implement the cloud upon independent hardware and applicatins aklowing for higher levels of control for development and application deployment. However, migrating to PaaS would require in-depth support due to the integration requirements with proprietary applications.

        <p>“Google AppEngine is a PaaS offering where developers write in Python or Java. EngineYard is Ruby on Rails. Sometimes PaaS providers have proprietary languages like force.com from Salesforce.com and Coghead, now owned by SAP.” (Bhardwaj, 2010) </p>

      <p class="content">
        Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is comprised of the provision of hardware requirements and software application. The client has more control and flexibility with this service. Migrating or intergrating to an IaaS Cloud solution would have the least path of resistance compared to PaaS and SaaS due to the lack of architectural change required and would be achieved through lift and shift approach.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p>“Unlike PaaS services, the IaaS provider does very little management other than keep the data center operational and users must deploy and manage the software services themselves just the way they would in their own data center. Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Secure Storage Service (S3) are examples of IaaS offerings.” (Bhardwaj, 2010) </p>
