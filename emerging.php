        The proliferation of IoT devices fuels the migration and incorporation of mobile and cloud computing in the recent years has prompted innovation to NM. Applications and services require features such as lower-latency, quality of service (QoS), quality of experience (QoE), and higher bandwidth, and this is only expected to grow. Branch-to-data centres are becoming less ideal in areas such as financial expenditure and remote access in comparison to software-defined wide-area networking (SD-WAN). This technology provides a single cover encompassing network management, security, software as a service (SaaS), cloud integration and real-time enforcement, ease in application deployment, and better overall performance. A key proponent of SD-WAN is Cisco;       </p>

      <p>“With the power of software-defined networking on the WAN, businesses can improve performance, reduce costs, and stay secure. It's a cloud-first, software-driven approach that routes traffic, maintains application performance, and adapts to changing conditions—all without direct IT oversight.” (Cisco, SD-WAN: the new landscape of networking, 2019)</p>

        The new 802.11ax standard (WiFi6), endeavours to enhance the current 2.4GHz frequency which has not been updated since the 802.11n standard. In addition, the amplified speeds of WiFi6 are “3 times faster than 802.11ac” (Cisco, 2019). This new standard will also facilitate the increasing volume of IoT devices. Machine learning will also aid network management due to the increase in data from the IoT device growth. The use of machine learning, and AI will allow for autonomous management.
        Another emerging technology that is expected to work collectively with SD-WAN is 5G. The fifth generation of wireless network is estimated to be a revolutionary step in IoT networking with roll out predictions to be over the next few years.
