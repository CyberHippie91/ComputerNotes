			Python’s ease in learning curve, vast community resources (such as the Python Software Foundation (PSF)) and highly readable syntax renders it popular with beginners. Python also caters for a faster development and entry to market. This is due to its concise and high-level syntax (indentations rather than ending brackets or tags, etc.) which is possible because of previous language failings and lessons learnt. Amongst other benefits such as interoperability with other languages, cross-platform capability, scalability, and toolkits such as the Tk GUI (tkinter 3.X) allowing for modification to the GUI without modification to the program, Python caters for high-performance using automatic memory management and dynamic typing. These benefits compared with other languages presents the following:
			
				<blockquote> “It is more powerful than Tcl. […] Is more readable than Perl. […] Is simpler and easier to use than C# and Java. […] Is simper and easier to use than C++. […] Is simpler and higher-level than C. […] Is more powerful, general purpose and cross-platform than Visual Basic. […] Is more readable and general purpose than PHP and JavaScript […] Is more readable and general purpose than Ruby […] More mature and broadly focused than Lua. […] Is less esoteric than SmallTalk, Lisp and Prolog.” (Lutz, 2013)  </blockquote>
			
			Python can either utilise its interpreter software or it can be complied with support from external extensions such as PyPy depending on the requirements and the needs of the business. However, the interpreted Python will be slower than in comparsion to compiled. 
			
				<blockquote> “Because it is an interpreted language, it is often many times slower than compiled languages, However, it comes back to separating the language from the runtime. Certain benchmarks of Python code run under PyPy run faster than the equivalent C code or others.” (Krill, 2015) </blockquote>
			
			As the language is a high-level language with a small learning curve and powerful features, the security configuration and management tool of LO4 will be developed and written in python. Due to previous experience with html/css and bootstrap, the website and content will be developed in the bootstrap framework. This allows for robust responsiveness and dynamic content.

			PHP, developed in 1994 and previously known as Personal Home Pages, is responsible for: server-side scripting within the web server, web browser and PHP parser components; command-line scripting used for smaller more administrative tasks utilising the PHP parser; and client-side GUI applications using the extension PHP-GTK to develop cross-platform GUI’s (Tatroe et al. 2013). In relation to your business needs, SE Web solutions employs the server-side scripting facet of PHP to formulate web applications due to its wide integration with databases and its cross-platform characteristics (choice of web browser and OS). </p>
			
				<blockquote> “PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many Unix variants (including HP-UX, Solaris and OpenBSD), Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, RISC OS, and probably others. PHP has also support for most of the web servers today. This includes Apache, IIS, and many others. And this includes any web server that can utilize the FastCGI PHP binary, like lighttpd and nginx. PHP works as either a module, or as a CGI processor.” (PHP Community, 2001) </blockquote>
				
			<p>
			The open source nature of PHP makes it a viable option for businesses due to its lack of financial cost as well as the simple learning curve involved in understanding and operating the language, however employability of a web development company such as SE will alleviate the need for the business to learn such languages. The provision of a framework such as PEAR from and for the PHP community provides developers with a multitude of resources for common tasks in conjunction with vast libraries. Another benefit to union of PHP and web development is the ease in integration between other languages such as HTML and other protocols such as HTTP, SNMP and LDAP allowing for more efficient and seamless user experience in addition to a faster development process. </p>
			
				<blockquote> “PHP has support for the WDDX complex data exchange between virtually all Web programming languages. Talking about interconnection, PHP has support for instantiation of Java objects and using them transparently as PHP objects.” (PHP Community, 2001) </blockquote>
				
			<p>
			In addition to these benefits, PHP can provide dynamic content in the form of files such as: PDF’s; image files such as JPEG, PNG and GIF; text files in the form of XML and XHTML; and flash video files to which are cached in the memory module of PHP on the web server to enable fast performance (Tatroe et al. 2013). With the latest version of PHP being released and much of web development utilising PHP, it is likely that many development firms, web hosting companies and other areas using PHP will upgrade to the latest version this year. </p>
				
			<p>
			Although PHP can comprehend large complex tasks with the application of Object Orientated Programming, the process can become overly complicated and difficult for other programmers to aid and develop on the same project. With an open source ethos, low barriers to entry, and PHP’s popular nature, there is the potential for inconsistent and corrupt code as well as security risks. With PHP and database integration, attacks such as SQL injections become a prime concern. Attackers can formulate and input malicious code to gain entry to the database with the intent of exploiting, modifying or deleting the entire records.   </p>
