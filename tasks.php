        Fault management is supported by the establishment of protocols such as Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), system log (syslog) and remote monitoring (RMON) for identification, recording and troubleshooting purposes. Through the platform, the administrator can centrally execute protocols such SNMP and MIB to support analyse and translate the fault protocol aspects and findings as well as performance.

        Configuration management can be achieved through the compliance with all standards, legislation and licensing agreements as well as the construction of a database housing all relevant and up to date details of inventory to aid organisation. Regular maintenance and back up should be undertaken to safeguard integrity. Performance management will begin with the construction of a service level agreement (SLA) between the ISP and the client in addition to one between the Network Administrator or business owner and their employees and clients. This contract will state the terms and conditions of use. SNMP and MIB will be able to monitor transmission and throughput speeds of protocols and device attributes such as Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), Frame Relay DTE Interface Type MIB, DNS Server MIB and FDDI (Mauro and Schmidt, 2005).       </p>

      <p class="content">
        Security management should include a detailed security policy devised of the protocols and mitigation techniques proposed and implemented as well as security details for each device.  SNMP will provide the capability to execute security configuration procedures through Network Access Control (NAC) applications. Following the architecture of AAA, good practices such as the following will be managed. Each network device should be configured with passwords for all modes to mitigate physical attacks in addition to each client maintaining a unique username and secret password.

        The implementation of security configuration for ports should follow the shutdown if not in use mandate. Subsections in relation to business specifics such as VLAN’s should be implemented in the network design following standards such as configuring an alternative VLAN number than the default 1 for native and management VLAN’s to diminish the vulnerability to unauthorised access. Access Control Lists (ACL) should be configured to determine authorised addresses within a network. A firewall and NAT device should be installed to provide an autonomous and anonymous defence when connecting to public networks such as the internet. A reliable and trusted virus and malware protection software should be incorporated. Account management refers to the collection and analysation of data traffic of users throughout the network to ensure accordance with the SLA.

        <p>“The data can be collected via probes or Cisco NetFlow. Cisco provides NetFlow Collector and NetFlow Analyzer applications for gathering and analysing data from routers and Catalyst switches. Shareware applications such as cflowd are also used to gather NetFlow data.” (Cisco, 2007) </p>

  Other tasks can include migration. In cloud, the lift and shift approach subsequently removes the entire application (and all data, policies and administration procedures related) from one environment and transfers to the cloud environment. “They should be mapped from what is currently available in source infrastructure to the matching resources in the cloud provider” (Perry, 2018) . The advantages to this method include low migration costs, low support required and minimal changes to structure.
